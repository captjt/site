My strengths include backend architecting/implementations along with designing and implementing front end client application. I develop in modern stack methodologies with a mind for advancing in my learning for new languages and open source frameworks. I love solving unique problem with efficient designs and solutions is what drives me. I love every part of the development stack and come from a Computer Science background with double concentrations of Software Engineering and Databases.

If there is one language that I would advocate for people to learn and understand well it's Go. I am an avid believer in the future of Go and everything that comes with it.
