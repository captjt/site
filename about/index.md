I love tinkering with software while learning new technologies. I am a polyglot engineer at heart. My strengths include designing & implementing backend + frontend applications. Passionate about microservices and all of the complexities that come with them! I develop in modern stack methodologies with a mind in advancement in learning new languages and open source frameworks. I strive for solving unique problems with efficient and effective solutions. I love every part of the development stack and come from a CS background with double concentrations of Software Engineering and Databases.

If there is one language that I would advocate for people to learn and understand well it's Go. I am an avid believer that the future of Go is great!

While it might seem I enjoy to code with all the time I have. I do love to workout, watch baseball -- I used to play Division I @ [Radford University](http://www.radfordathletics.com/index.aspx?path=baseball)) -- and I always enjoy spending time with my lovely girlfriend and our child with paws, Izzy.

If you want to reach out to me about anything regarding software development or how amazing the St. Louis Cardinals are please shoot me an email or you can find me on Twitter [@jt_0021](http://www.twitter.com/jt_0021).
