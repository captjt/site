I'm Jordan, a software engineer in the Washington, D.C. area. I focus on
developing and maintaining distributed systems in Go and NodeJS. I've come to
enjoy studying, developing and architecting distributed systems. I strive for
solving unique problems with efficient and effective solutions.

I am lucky enough to develop backend systems, while maintaining platform
operations and uptime for an augmented reality platform, [Skylight](https://upskill.io/skylight/skylight-overview/).

Outside of software and coding I love to workout, watch baseball, and enjoy
spending time with my lovely girlfriend and our child with paws, Izzy. Fun fact:
I used to play Division I @ [Radford University](http://www.radfordathletics.com/index.aspx?path=baseball).

If you want to reach out to me about anything regarding software, DevOps,
or how amazing the St. Louis Cardinals are you can find me on Twitter
