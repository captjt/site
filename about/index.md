I love tinkering with software while learning new technologies. I am a polyglot engineer at heart. My strengths include architecting & implementing backend + frontend applications. Passionate about microservices and all of the complexities that come with them! I develop in modern stack methodologies with a mind in advancement in learning new languages and open source frameworks. I strive for solving unique problems with efficient and effective solutions. I love every part of the development stack and come from a Computer Science background with double concentrations of Software Engineering and Databases.

If there is one language that I would advocate for people to learn and understand well it's Go. I am an avid believer in the future of Go!

While it might seem I enjoy to code with all the time I have. I do love to workout, watch baseball (previously a Division I ballplayer @ [Radford University](http://www.radfordathletics.com/index.aspx?path=baseball)), and spend time with my lovely girlfriend and our child with paws -- Izzy.
