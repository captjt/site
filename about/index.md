I'm JT, a Software and DevOps engineer in the Washington, D.C. area. I focus
on developing and maintaining distributed systems in Go, NodeJS and Python. I've
come to enjoy studying, developing and architecting distributed systems. I 
strive for solving unique problems with efficient and effective solutions.

Currently, I am a Lead DevOps Engineer @ Accenture Federal Services within 
Accenture Federal's [Digital Studio](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/service-accenture-federal-digital-studio)
driving how government can transform their workloads through containers, 
Kubernetes and cloud platforms.

Previously, I was lucky enough to develop backend systems, while maintaining
platform operations and uptime for an augmented reality platform, [Skylight](https://upskill.io/skylight/skylight-overview/).

Outside of software, systems and coding I love to workout, watch baseball, and 
enjoy spending time with my lovely fianc√©e and our child with paws, Izzy. 
Fun fact: I used to play Division I @ [Radford University](http://www.radfordathletics.com/index.aspx?path=baseball).

If you want to reach out to me about anything regarding software, DevOps,
or how amazing the St. Louis Cardinals are you can find me on Twitter
