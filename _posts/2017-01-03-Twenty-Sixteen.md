### 2016 in Review

Twenty-sixteen was definitely a year to remember. I constantly look back thinking about all the things that changed in my life from graduating from undergrad, finishing my baseball career, to pushing production code the first day on the job, leading and contributing to some fantastic applications within the State Department... it's been a crazy year.

When it comes to growing in my technology life I was so back and forth with languages. When I first came out of college I had a ton of experience with PHP and Java so obviously I loved what I knew. Little did I start leaning towards the more "hip" languages like Node and JavaScript.  I was the typical JS fanboy (and still am) but it was a complete change in mindset of how concurrency worked without having to architect major multi threaded applications.  To say the least it was a hit.  I got to enjoy the great complexities of the JavaScript language at it's finest using it in the frontend with ReactJS and also on the server side.

But then, I decided to look into Python because it wasn't new and it was a solid language that people have been developing with for year.  It was hitting a soft spot in my heart because it really was so simple and easy for me to take all the CS concepts I already knew and apply them super easy and fast with a scripting language.  I could iterate on applications pretty fast without having to handle JavaScript callbacks with promises and async/await.  I fell in love with it I could also do some awesome machine learning odds and ends with packages like numpy, scikit-learn, etc.  The biggest thing I missed from Node was the concurrency though - as much as a pain callbacks were to wrap my head around at first.  Enter the room... Go.

I don't really remember how Golang ("Go") was introduced to me but I must say it's been an adventure to say the least.  The community around Go is growing more and more everyday - not many people really understand how powerful Go can be.  I love the concurrency model - no more promises and callback pyramids you get thrown into like you did in JavaScript; there aren't crazy multiple threading issues you run into like in Java.  The magic is in the CSP-Model (Communicating Sequential Processes) -- you have these channels that bridge messages sent between "goroutines" that are running concurrent processes.  You wait and block while messages are getting sent through these "channels" it's a beautiful and simple complexity once you understand how powerful they can be.  There are so many amazing things that are being built in Go - it seems that the future of distributed systems and development is being written in Go.  The big players in the tech business are using it and backing it -- Uber, DropBox, Docker, DigitalOcean, and many more... oh and Google (they made/maintain it).

Learning more about all things technology is my passion I couldn't have imagined how much I've learned since starting my professional career but it's been fantastic so far and I can't wait for the next year's challenges!  Polyglot is the best mentality I have -- I think the best builders use all their tools to their best abilities.  Having a strong base of many languages is at the core of what I think it means to be a software engineer.

#### The Year to Come

Top things to do in 2017

* Expand more on containers and container orchestration (Docker + Kubernetes?)
* More open source development...currently none :(
* Look into open source projects...per previous TODO
* Expand on more ReactJS applications (or insert favorite JS Framework)
* Get more into "non" SQL based databases
    * Previous usage of Elasticsearch and Neo4J
* Go, Go, and more Go (learning Go has been awesome so far -- keep GOing!)
